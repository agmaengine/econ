# Gini Coefficient

Gini coefficient is one of the inequality measure, it measures statistical dispersion of data

Gini coefficient was developed by Corrado Gini and intended to represent income inequality, However, the applications can be extended to any quantitative samples such as, ecology diversity.

in contast to standard deviation, which is the first choice when dispersion of data is interested, Gini coefficient is bound from 0 to 1. This boundedness gives better understanding for wider audiences.

Gini coefficient is based on Lorenz curve which is a graphical representation of income distribution and also inequality.

## Definitions

**Samples**

samples are group of thing, we are interested in, each sameple contains their measurable quantities such as income. a measurable quantity of a sample is represented by $x_i$ where $i$ is the sample index. $\{x_i\}$ is the that contains the measurable quantity of every sample.

**Partial Sum**

Partial sum of the $i^{th}$ term of a sequnces is the sum of the members of the sequence from first to $i^{th}$ terms
given a sequence

$$
(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, ... )
$$

Partial sum of the $i^{th}$ term of the sequnces is

$$
S_i = \sum_{n=1}^i{a_i}
$$

**Sorted Sequence of a Measurable**

given a set of a measurable of samples $\{x_i\}$, we sorted the sample such that

$$
x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < x_4 < ... < x_i < ... < x_N
$$

The sorted sequence of the measureable are

$$
(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, ..., x_i, x_N)
$$

**Lorenz Curve**

Lorenz curve are tuples of partial sum of samples proportion sequence and partial sum of sorted measurable proportion sequence

Let lorenz curve of a samples be $\{(f_i, l_i)\}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_i &= \sum_{n=1}^i 
\end{aligned}
$$
